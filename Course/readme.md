This is a Python Django web application that provides an online course system, allowing users to enroll in courses, take exams, and view their results.

The app consists of several Django views (CourseListView, CourseDetailView, ExamDetailView, etc.) that are responsible for handling HTTP requests and rendering the corresponding HTML templates.

The app relies on several Django models (Course, Enrollment, Choice, Submission) that represent the course content, student enrollment, exam questions and answers, and exam submissions.

The app allows students to enroll in courses and take exams. When a student submits an exam, the app calculates the total score, passing score, and the correctness of the selected answers. The app then displays the exam result along with detailed feedback on each question.
